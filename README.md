# 👨‍💻 About This Project
Assembly Endgame is a Hangman-style word guessing game built with React.  
I made this project during my first week learning React to practice hooks, state management, and component interactions. 🚀  

It’s a fun way to see how dynamic UIs update in real-time and how game logic can be handled with React.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Click letters on the on-screen keyboard to guess them.
- Correct guesses reveal letters in the word.

- Click **New Game** to start over.
